Key Findings on EC2 Security Group Best Practices

Focus: Least Privilege and Common Anti-Patterns

Least Privilege Principles:
- Only allow the minimum necessary traffic to and from your instances.
- Restrict inbound and outbound rules to specific IP address ranges (CIDR blocks) or other security groups instead of using 0.0.0.0/0.
- Use security groups to control access between instances within your VPC.
- Regularly review and remove unused rules to maintain minimal exposure.

Common Anti-Patterns:
- Allowing unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0) to sensitive ports such as SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389), which can expose instances to brute-force attacks.
- Opening all ports (0-65535) in security group rules, creating overly permissive configurations.
- Relying on the default security group without customizing rules for specific use cases.
- Not auditing security groups periodically, leading to accumulation of outdated or overly broad rules.
- Using security groups as a substitute for network ACLs or other security layers, rather than as complementary controls.

Additional Recommendations:
- Use descriptive names and tags for security groups to improve manageability.
- Implement automation for security group management to ensure consistency.
- Monitor security group changes using AWS CloudTrail and Config for compliance.
