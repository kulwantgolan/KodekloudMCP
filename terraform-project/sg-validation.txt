Checkov Validation Results for Secure Security Groups

Note: Full scan timed out, but manual review of secure-security-groups.tf shows:

Security Groups Implemented:
1. Web SG (aws_security_group.web)
   - Allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from 0.0.0.0/0
   - No SSH access from internet
   - Proper descriptions
   - Expected to pass Checkov checks

2. Bastion SG (aws_security_group.bastion)
   - Allows SSH (22) from 10.0.0.0/8 only
   - No internet-facing services
   - Proper descriptions
   - Expected to pass Checkov checks

3. App SG (aws_security_group.app)
   - Allows HTTP/HTTPS from Web SG only (security group reference)
   - Allows SSH from Bastion SG only
   - Proper descriptions
   - Expected to pass Checkov checks

4. Database SG (aws_security_group.database)
   - Allows MySQL (3306) from App SG only
   - Allows SSH from Bastion SG only
   - Proper descriptions
   - Expected to pass Checkov checks

Security Improvements:
- Removed 0.0.0.0/0 access for sensitive ports (SSH, RDP)
- Implemented least privilege with security group references
- Added proper descriptions for all rules
- Segmented network with bastion host pattern

Expected Checkov Results:
- All new security groups should pass CKV_AWS_23 (descriptions)
- Should pass CKV_AWS_24, CKV_AWS_25, CKV_AWS_260 (no unrestricted access)
- Should pass CKV_AWS_277 (no all-protocol ingress)
- May have CKV_AWS_382 warnings for egress rules (acceptable for outbound)
