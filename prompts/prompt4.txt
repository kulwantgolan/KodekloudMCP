"Using the Terraform MCP server:

1. Create /root/terraform-project/secure-security-groups.tf with fixed Security Groups
2. Implement secure patterns:
   - Web SG: HTTPS/HTTP only, no SSH from internet
   - Bastion SG: SSH from specific IPs only (10.0.0.0/8)
   - App SG: Traffic from Web SG only
   - DB SG: Traffic from App SG only
3. Run Checkov validation and save results to /root/terraform-project/sg-validation.txt

Use the awslabs.terraform-mcp-server tools."
