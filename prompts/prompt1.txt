"Using the CloudFormation MCP server, analyze AWS Security Groups:

1. List all security groups (AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup) from us-east-1 and save to /root/aws-security-groups.txt

2. For each security group found, get detailed information including:
   - Ingress rules (inbound traffic)
   - Egress rules (outbound traffic)
   - Associated VPC
   - Save details to /root/sg-details.txt

3. Create a security analysis summary at /root/security-groups-summary.txt that includes:
   - Total number of security groups
   - Any security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 access (potential risk)
   - Security groups allowing SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389)
   - Security groups with all ports open

Use the cfn-mcp-server tools to query these resources."
